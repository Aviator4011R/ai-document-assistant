Learn to trim for takeoff so that only a very light back pressure on the wheel is\nrequired to lift the airplane off the ground.\nThe best speed for takeoff is about 70 MPH under normal conditions. Trying to pull\nthe airplane off the ground at too low an airspeed decreases the controllability of the\nairplane in event of engine failure.\nFlaps may be lowered at airspeeds up to 125 MPH. To reduce flap operating loads, it\nis desirable to have the airplane at a slower speed before extending the flaps.\nBefore attempting to reset any circuit breaker, allow a two to five minute cooling off\nperiod.\nBefore starting the engine, check that all radio switches, light switches and the pitot\nheat switch are in the off position so as not to create an overloaded condition when\nthe starter is engaged.\nThe overvoltage relay is provided to protect the electronics equipment from a\nmomentary overvoltage condition (approximately 16.5 volts and up), or a\ncatastrophic regulator failure.
