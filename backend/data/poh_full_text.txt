DESCRIPTION
AIRPLANE AND SYSTEMS
THE AIRPLANE
The PA-32-300 is a six-place (seventh seat optional), single-engine, low-wing. all metal
monoplane. Removable seats give the airplane a wide range of cargo and passenger loading options.
Its large capacity, combined with an economical and powerful fuel injected 300horsepowerengine.
rnakes this Cherokee a versatile airplane for personal or commercial use.
AIRFRAME
Except for the tubular steel engine mount, steel landing gear struts, other miscellaneous steel
parts, and the dent resistant fiberglass extremities - cowling and tips of wings and tail surfaces - the
basic airframe is of aluminum alloy.
The fuselage is a conventional semi-monocoque structure with a cabin door on the right front
and a cargo and passenger door on the left rear.
The wings are attached to each side of the fuselage by the insertion'of the butt ends of the
mainspars into a spar box carry-through which is an integral part of the fuselage structure. This
provides, in effect, a continuous main spar with splices at each side of the fuselage. There arc also
fore and aft attachments at the rear spar and at an auxiliary front spar.
. The wing airfoil section is a laminar flow type, NACA65r4l5 with a maximum thickness at
about 40Vo aft of the leading edge.
The empennage consists of the fin, the stabilator, and the stabilator trim tab.
ENGINE AND PROPELLER
The Lycoming lO-5{0'KlA5 (Serial nos. 7440001 through 7640065 and 7640067 through'7ffi71 or lO-540-KlG5 (Serial nos. 764+Cf,66,7640072and up) engine installed in the PA-32'300 is
rated at 300 horsepower at 2700 rpm. This engine has a compression ratio of 8.7 to I and required
100/ 130 minimum octane fuel. The engine is equipped with a gearcd starter,a 60amperealternator,
dual magnetos, vacuum pump drive, a vane-type fuel pump, and fuel injection.
The exhaust system consists ofdual exhaust stacks routed to a single heavy gauge stainless steel
muffler on serial numbers 7440001 through 7540188. On later models individual exhaust pipes are
routed in pairs to three heavy gauge stainless steel mufflers. Exhaust gases are routed overboard at
the underside of the engine cowling. The muffler (or mufflers) are surrounded by a shroud which
provides heat for the cabin and for windshield defrosting.
Cowling on the Cherokee Six is designed to cool the engine in all normal flight conditions.
including protracted climb, without the use of cowl flaps or cooling flanges.

CHEROKEE SIX.3OO
The constant speed propeller is a Hartzell HC-C2YK- I ( )F/ F8475D-4 with a diameter of 80
inches. The propeller is controlled by a governor mounted at the left forward side of the crankcase .
The governor is operated by a cable from the power control quadrant.
The power control quadrant located in the lower center of the instrument panel includes
throttle, mixture. and propeller controls. A friction lock on the right side of the quadrant prevents
creeping of the controls. In addition. the mixture control has a lock* to prevent activation of the
mixture control instead of the pitch control. For information on the leaning procedure, see the
Avco-Lycoming Operator's Manual.
INDUCTION SYSTEM
On Serial Numbers 74y',0001 through 7540188, the Induction Air for the engine enters an
opening in the nose cowl below the propeller and is picked up by a large air duct. The air is directed
through a filter and on to the servo regulator. Should the filter become blocked, a springJoaded
door in the air box between the lilter and the servo regulator opens automatically. The door may
also be opened manually by a control located on the right side of the quadrant.
,,: Qn Serial Numbers 764000 | and up, an induction scoop is located on the left side of the lower
cbwl. An intake air box is attached to the inside of the cowl adjacent to the air filter box. The filter
box is located at the aft end of the induction scoop. Access to the filter is gained through a
detachable plate located on the outside of the lower cowl. The intake air box incorporates a
manually operated two-way valve designed to allow induction air either to pass through the filter or
to bypass the filter and supply heated air directly to the engine.
Alternate air selection insures induction air flow should the filter become blocked. Since the air
is heated, the alternate air system offers protection against induction system blockage caused by
snow or freezing rain, or by the freezing of moisture accumulated in the induction air filter.
Alternate air is unfiltered; therefore, it should not be used during ground operation when dust or
other contaminants might enter the system. The primary (through the filter) induction source
should always be used for takeoffs. On serial numbers 7640001 and up, the control is operated by
pressing the knob to the left to clear the retaining gate and then moved in the desired direction.
The Bendix RSA-lOED I type fuel injection system consists of a servo regulator which meters
fuel flow in proportion to airflow to the engine, giving the proper fuel-air mixture at all engine
speeds, and a fuel flow divider which receives the metered fuel and accurately divides the fuel flow
among the individual cylinder fuel nozzles.
A combination fuel flow indicator and manifold pressure gauge is installed in the left side of the
instrument panel. The fuel flow indicator is connected to the fuel flow divider and monitors fuel
pressure. The instrument converts fuel pressure to an accurate indication of fuel flow in gallons per
hour and percentage of cruise power.

LANDING GEAR
All three landing gear use Cleveland 6.00 x 6 wheels. The main gear have brake drums and
Cleveland double disc hydrualic brake assemblies. The nose wheel carries a 6.00 x 6 four or six
ply tire and the main gear use 6.00 x 6 six ply tires. All three tires are tube type.
The nose gear is steerable using a combination of full rudder pedal travel and brakes. The
nose gear can be tumed 24o each side of center. A spring device is incorporated in the rudder
pedal torque tube assembly to aid in rudder centering and to provide rudder trim. The nose gear
also includes a shimmy dampener.
The oleo struts,are of the air-oil type. The normal extensions, arc,3-l l4 inches. for the nose
gear and 4l 12 inches for the main gear under normal static load (empg weight of airplane plus
full fuel and oil).
The brakes are operated by toe pedals attached to the left rudder pedals or by a hand lever
and master cylinder located below and behind the left center of the instrument sub-panel.
Optional toe brakes are available for the right rudder pedals. Hydraulic cylinden are located
above each pedal and adjacent to the hand lever. The brake fluid reservoir is on the top left
front of the fue wall. The parking brake is incorporated in the lever brake and is engaged by
p'uling back on the lever and depressing the knob attached to the top of the handle. To release
the parking brake, pull back on the brake lever to disengage the catch; then allow the handle to
sri'ing forward.

FUGHT CONTROLS
Dual controls, with a cable system between the controls and the surfaces, are installed as
standard equipment.
The horizontal tail is of the all-movable slab type (stabilator). The stabilator provides extra
stability and controllability with less size, drag, and weight than conventional tail surfaces.
An anti-servo tab which also acts as a longitudinal trim tab, is located on the horizontal
tail. This tail is actuated by a control mounted on the control tunnel between the front seats.
The ailerons are provided with a differential action which tends to eliminate adverse yaw in
turning maneuver and to reduce the amount of coordination required in normal furns.
The flaps are manually operated, balanced for light operating forces, and spring-loaded to
retum to the up position. A past-center lock incorporated in the actuating linkage holds the flap
when it is in the up position so that it may be used as a step on the right side. Since the flap will
not support a step load except in the full up position, it should be completely retracted when
the airplane is on the ground. The flaps have three extended positions, 10, 25, and 40 degrees.

FUEL SYSTEM
The standard fuel capacity of the Cherokee Six is 84 gallons, all of which is usable except
for approximately one pint in each of the four tanks. The two main inboard tanks, which hold
25 gallons each, ate attached to the wing structure with screws and nut plates and can be
removed easily for service or inspection. The tip tanks are constructed of resin-impregnated
fiberglass, and each one holds l7 gallons.
When using less than the standard 84 gallon capacity of the tanks, fuel should be distributed
equally between each side. The tip tanks should always be filled first, and fuel from the main tanks
should be used first. All weight in excess of 3ll2 pounds must be in fuel weight only.
The fuel selector control is located below the center of the instrument panel on the sloping
face of the control tunnel. It has five positions, one position corresponding to each of the four
tanks plus an OFF position.
To avoid the accumulation of water and sediment, the fuel system should be drained daily
prior to first flight and after refueling. Each tank is equipped with an individual quick drain
located at the lower inboard rear comer of the tank. The fuel strainer and a system quick drain
valve are located in the fuselage at the lowest p<irint of the fuel system. It is important that the
fuel system be drained in the following manner:
l. Drain each tank through its individual quick drain located at the lower inboard rear
corner of the tank, making sure that enough fuel has flowed to ensure the remorral of
all water and sediment.
2. Place a container beneath the fuel sump drain outlet located under the fuselage. A
special container is fumished for this operation.
3. Drain the fuel strainer by pressing down on the lever located on the right side o,f the
cabin on the forward edge of the wing spar housing. Move the selector through the
following sequence: OFF position, left tip, left main, right main, and right tip while
draining the strainer. Make sure that enough fuel has flowed to drain the fuel line
between each tank outlet and the fuel strainer, as well as the strainer itself. With full
fuel tanks, it will take approximately I I seconds to drain all the fuel in one of the
fuel lines from the tip tank to the strainer, and approximately 6 seconds to drain all
of the fuel from the line from either main tank to the fuel strainer. When the tanks
are less than full, it will take a few seconds longer.
4. Examine the contents of the container placed under the fuel sump drain outlet. When
the fuel flow is free of water and sediment, close the drain and dispose of the
contents of the bottle.
CAUTION
When draining fuel, care should be taken to ensure that no fre
hazard exists before starting the engine.
After using the undeneat quick drain, check from the outside to make sure that it has
closed completely and is not leaking.

Fuel quantity gauges for each of the four tanks are located in the engine l3uge cluster on the left
side of the instrument panel. A fuel pressure indictor is also incorporated in the engine gauge cluster.
An electric fuel pump is provided for use in case of failure of the engine driven pump. The
electric pump operates from a single switch and independent circuit protector. It should be ON for
all takeoffs and landings.
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
The l4-volt electrical system includes a l2-volt brttery for starting and to back up alternator
output. Electrical power is supplied by a 60 ampere rlternaior. The battery, a master switch relay, a
voltage regulator and an overvoltage relay are located beneath the floor of the forward baggage
compartnient, and access is obtained by removing the floor.
Electricel switches are located on a panel to the pilot's left and all circuit breakers are on the
lower right instrument panel behind a decorative door. Two thumb-wheel rheostat switches to the
left of the circuit breakers control the navigation lights and the intensity of the instrument panel
lights.

cHEROttEE SrX-300
Standard electrical accessories include the starter. the electric fuel pump, the stall warning
indicator. the cigar lighter, the ammeter, and the annunciator panel*.
The annunciator panel* includes alternator and low oil pressure indicator lights. When the
optional gyro system is installed, the annunciator panel also includes a low vacuum indicator light.
The annunciator panel lights are provided only as a warning to the pilot that a system may not be
operating properly. and that he should check and monitor the applicable system gauge to determine
when or if any necessary action is required.
Optional electrical tccessories include the navigation lights. an anti-collision light, and
instrument panel lighting.
Circuit provisions are made to handle a full complernent of communications and navigational
equipment.
The alternator system offers many advantages over a generator system. The main advantage is
full electrical power output at much lower engine speed. which results in improved radio and
electrical equipment operation. Since the alternator output is available all the time, the battery will
be charging almost continuously. This will make cold weather starting easier.
The ammeter in the alternator system displays in amperes the load placed on the alternator. It
does not indicate battery discharge. With all electrical equipment off (except the masterswitch)the
arirmeter will be indicating the amount of charging current demanded by the battery. As each item of
electrical equipment is turned on, the current will increase to a total appearing on the ammeter. This
t6tal includes the battery. The maximum continuous load for night flight, with radios on, is about 30
amperes. This 30 ampere value, plus approximately 2 amperes for a fully charged battery, will
appear continuously under these flight.conditions.
The msster switch is a split switch with the left half operating the master relay and the right half
energizing the alternator. This switch is interlocked so that the alternator cannot be operated
without the battery. For normal operation, be sure that both halves are turned on.
If no output is indicated by the ammeter during flight, reduce the electrical load by turning off
all unnecessary electrical equipment. Check both the 5 ampere field breaker and the 50 ampere
output breaker and reset if open. If neither circuit breaker is open, turn off the alternator switch for I
second to reset the ovewoltage relay. If the ammeter continues to indicate no output, turn off the
alternator switch; maintain a minimum electrical load; and terminate the flight as soon as practical.
Maintenance on the alternator should prove to be a minor factor. Should service be required,
contact a Piper Dealer.

VACI,JUM SYSTEM
The vacuum system employed to operate the gyro instruments includes an engine-driven
dry vacuum pump, a vacuum regulator valve, and the tubing necessary to complete the system.
The use of a dry type vacuum pump eliminates the need for an oil-air separator and the
hardware necessary for its installation.
The vacuum gauge is mounted on the right side of the instrument panel. The gauge is
calibrated in inches of mercury and indicates the amount of suction created by the
engine-driven vacuum pump. As the systern filter becomes clogged or the lines obstructed, the
gauge will show a decrease in pressure (a low vacuum indicator light is provided in the
annunciator panel*). Do not reset the regulator until the filter and lines have been checked.
A vacuum regulator valve is incorporated in the system to control vacuum pressure to the
gyro instruments. The regulator valve is located under the instrument panel. Access to the valve
for maintenance and adjustment is gained from below the instrument panel. The regulator
should be set so that the vacuum gauge reads 5.0 t .l inches of mercury with the engine running
at medium RPM after warm-up.
INSTRUMENT PANEL
The instrument panel of the Cherokee Six is designed to accommodate the customary
advanced flight instruments and the normally required power plant instruments. The artificial
horizon and directional gyro are vacuum operated and are located in the center of the left hand
instrument panel. The vacuum gauge is located on the right hand instrument panel. The turn
indicator, on the left side, is electrically operated.
A natural separation of the flight group and the power group is achieved by the placement
of the flight group in the upper instrument panel and the power group in the center and lower
instrument panels. The radios are located in the center section of the panel, and the circuit
breakers are in the lower right behind a decorative door.
An annunciator panel* is mounted in the upper instrument panel to warn the pilot of a
possible malfunction in the alternator, oil pressure, or vacuum systems.

PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM
The system supplies both pitot and static pressure for the airspeed indicator. altirneter and
vertical speed indicator (wlten installed).
Pitot and static pressure are picked up by the pitot head on the bottom of the left wing.
An optional heated pitot head, which alleviates problems with icing or heavy rain, is available.
The switch for pitot heat is located on the lower left instrument panel.
To prevent bugs and water from entering the pitot antl static pressure holes when tlte
airplape is parked, a cover should be placed over the pitot head. A partially or completely
blocked pitot head will give erratic or zero readings on the instruments'
NOTE
During preflight, check to make sure the pitot cover is removed.
HEATING AND VENTILATING SYSTEM
Heat for the cabin interior and the defroster system is drawn from a heater muff attached
to the exhaust system. Controls for these systems are located on the lower right side of the
instrunrent panel.
NOTE
If unusual odors are detected, turn off tlre heat and inspect the
system for leaks.
Fresh air inlets are located in the leading edge of each wing at the intersection of thc
tapered and straigfit sections, and in the leading edge of the fin. Two large adjustable outlets arc
located on each side of the cabin, one forward and one aft of the front seat near the floor.
There are also adjustable outlets above each seat. In airplanes without air conditioning. an
optional blower may be added to the overhead vent system to aid in the circulation of cabin air.
CABIN FEATURES
For ease of entry and exit and for pilot and passenger comflort. the front seats are
adjustable fore and aft. All seats recline and have armrests and are available with optional
headrests. The front seats can be equipped with optional vertical adjustment. The center and
rear seats are easily removed for additional cargo space. Some rear seat installations incorporate
lcg retainers with latching mechanisms which must bc released beforc the rear scats can bc
rentoved. Releasing the retainers is easily accomplished by turning the latching mechunisrrrs 90"
with a coin or screwdriver. An optionaljump seat can be installed between the two middle seats
to give the airplane a seven-place capacity.
SingJe strap shoulder harnesses controlled by inertia reels are standard equipment for thc
front seats and are offered as optional equipment for the third, fourth, fifth and sixth seats, but
not for the seventh seat. The shoulder strap is routed over the shoulder adjacent to the windows
and attached to the lap belt in the general area of the person's inboard hip.

The inertia reel should be checked by tugging sharply on the strap. The reel will lock in
place under this test and prevent the strap from extending. Under normal movement, the strap
will extend and retract as required.
BAGGAGE AREA
The airplane has two separate baggage areas, each with a 100 pound capacity. An 8 cubic
foot forward luggage compartment, located just aft of the fire wall, is accessible through a l6 x
22 inch door on the right side of the fuselage. A 22 cubic foot aft compartment is located
behind the fifth and sixth seats and is conveniently accessible even during flight from inside the
cabin.
NOTE
It is the pilot's responsibility to be sure when the baggage is
loaded that the airplane's C.G. falls within the allowable C.G.
range. (See Weight and Balance Section.)
STALL WARNING
An approaching stall is indicated by a stall warning indicator which is activated between
five and ten miles per hour above stall speed. Mild airframe buffeting and gentle pitching may
also precede the stall. Stall speeds are shown on graphs in the Performance Charts Section. The
stall warning indicator is a red warning light on the left side of the instrument panel on earlier
models and a continuous sounding hom located behind the instrument panel on later models.
The stall warning indicator is activated by a lift detector installed on the leading edge of the lift
wing. During preflight, the stall warning system should be checked by turning the master switch
"ON," lifting the detector and checking to deterrnine if the indicator is actuated.
FINISH
All exterior surfaces are primed with etching primer and finished with acrylic lacquer
available in a variety of colors and combinations. To keep the finish attractive looking, economy
size spray cans of touch-up paint are available from Piper Dealers.
AIR CONDTTIONING*
The air conditioning system is a recirculating aii system. The major components include an
evaporator, a condenser, a compressor, a blower, switches and temperature controls.
The evaporator is located behind the rear baggage compartment. This cools the air used for
the air conditioning system.
The condenser is mounted on a retractable scoop located on the bottom of the fuselage
and to the rear of the baggage compartment area. The scoop extends when the air conditioner is
ON and retracts to a flush position when the system is OFF.
The compressor is mounted on the forward right undenide of the engine. It has an electric
clutch which automatically engages or disengages the compre$pr to the belt drive system of the
compressor.

CHEROKEE SIX.3OO
An optioncl electric blower is mounted on the aft side of the rear cabin panel. Air from
the baggage area is drawn through the evaporator by the blower and distributed through an
overhead duct to individual outlets located adjacent to each occupant.
The switches and temperature control are located on the lower right side of the instrument
panel in the climate control center panel. The temperature control regulates the temperature of
the cabin. Turning the control clockwise increases cooling;counterclockwise decreases cooling.
The fan speed switch and the air conditioning ON-OFF switch are inboard of the
temperature control. The fan can be operated independently of the air conditioning;however,
the fan must be on for air conditioner operation. Turning either switch off will disengage the
compresso! clutch and retract the condenser door. Cooling air should be felt within one minute
after the air conditioner is turned on.
NOTE
If the system is not operating in 5 minutes, turn the system OFF
until the fault is corrected.
The fan switch alldws operation of the fan with the air conditioner turned OFF to aid in
cabin air circulation. "LOW," "MED" or "HIGH" can be selected to direct a flow of air through
the air conditioner outlets in the overhead duct. These outlets can be adiusted or turned off
individuallly.
The condenser door light is located to the rieht of the engine instrument cluster in front of
the pilot. The door light illuminates when the door is open and is off when the door is closed.
A circuit breaker on the circuit breaker panel protects the air conditioning electrical
system.
Whenever the throttle is in the full forward position, it actuates a micro switch which
disengages the compressor and retracts the scoop. This allows maximum power and maximum
rate of climb. The fan continues to operate and the air will remain cool for about one minute.
When the throttle is retarded approximately ll4 inch, the clutch will engage, the scoop will
extend, and the system will again supply cool, dry air.
PIPER EXTERNAL POWERI
An optional starting installation known as Piper External Power (PEP) is accessible through
a receptacle located on the left side of the nose section aft of the cowling. An external battery
can be connected to the socket, thus allowing the operator to crank the engine without having
to gain access to the airplane's battery.

Fuel System Preflight Procedure:
The fuel system should be drained daily prior to first flight and after refueling to
avoid the accumulation of water or sediment. Each fuel tank is equipped with an
individual quick drain located at the lower inboard rear corner of the tank. The fuel
strainer and a system quick drain valve are located in the fuselage at the lowest point
of the fuel system. It is important that the fuel system be drained in the following
manner:
a. Drain each tank through its individual quick drain located at the lower
inboard rear corner of the tank, making sure that enough fuel has been
drained to insure that all water and sediment is removed.
b. Place a container under the fuel sump drain outlet, which is located under
the fuselage
c. Drain the fuel strainer by pressing down on the lever located on the right
hand side of the cabin below the forward edge of the rear seat. The fuel
selector must be positioned in the following sequence: off position, left tip,
left main, right main, and right tip while draining the strainer to insure that
the fuel lines between each tank outlet and fuel strainer are drained as well
as the strainer. When the fuel tanks are full, it will take approximately l1
seconds to drain all the fuel in one of the lines between a tip tank and the
fuel strainer and approximately six seconds to drain all the fuel in one of
the lines from a main tank to the fuel strainer. When the fuel tanks are less
than full, it will take a few seconds longer.l.

EMER,GENCY PROCEDURES
INTRODUCTION
This section contains procedures that are recomrnended if an emergency condition should
occur during ground operation, takeoff, or in flight. These procedures are zuggested as the best
course of action for coping with the particular condition described, but are not a substitute for
sound judgment and common sense. Since emergencies rarely happen in modern aircraft, their
occuren@ is usually unexpected, and the best corrective action may not'always be obvious.
Pilots should familiarize themselves with the procedures given in this section and be prepared to
take appropriate action should an emergency arise.
Most basic emergency procedures, such as power off landings, are a normal part of piiot
training. Althoueh these emergencies are discussed here, this information is not intended to
replace such training, but only to provide a source of reference and review, and to provide
information on procedures which are not the same for all aircraft. It is suggested that the pilot
review standard emergency procedures periodically to remain proficient in them.
ENGINE POWER LOSS DI]RING TAKEOFF
The proper action to be taken if loss of power occun during takeoff will depend on
circumstances.
t. If sufficient runway remains for a normal landing, land straight ahead.
2. If insufficient runway remains, maintain a safe airspeed and make only a shallow turn
if necessary to avoid obstructions. Use of flaps depends on circumstances. Normally,
flaps should be fully extended for touchdown.
3. If you have gained sufficient altitude to attempt a restart, proceed as follows:
a. MAINTAIN SAFE AIRSPEED
b. FUEL SELECTOR . SWITCH TO ANOTI{ER TANK CONTAINING FUEL
c. ELECTRIC FIJEL PIrMP - CHECK ON
d. MIXTURE . CHECK RICH
e. ALTERNATE AIR - ON
NOTE
If engine failure was caused by fuel exhaustion, power will not be' regained after tanks are switched until empty fuel lines are filled,
which may require up to ten seconds.
If power is not regained, proceed with the POWER OFF LANDING procedure.

CHEROKEE SIX . 3OO
ENGINE POWER I,oSS IN FIIGHT
Complete engine power los is usually caused by fuel flow intemrption, and power will be
restored shortly after fuel flow is restored. If power loss occurs at low altitude, the first step is
to prepare for an emergency landing (See POWER OFF LANDING). Maintain an airspeed of at
least 100 MPH IAS, and if altitude permits, proceed as follows:
l. Fuel Selector - Switch to another tank containing fuel.
2. Electric Fuel hrmp - On
3. Mixture - Rich
4. Alternate Air - On
5. Engine Gauges - Check for an indication of the cause of power loss.
6. If no fuel pressure is indicated, check tank selector position to be sure it is on a tank
containing fuel.
When power is restored:
8. Altemate Air - Off
9. Electric Fuel hrmp - Off
If the above steps do not restore power, prepare for an emergency landing.
If time permits:
l. Ignition Switch - "L" then "R" then back to "BOTH."
2. Throttle and Mixture - Different settings. (This may restore power if the problem is
too rich or too lean a mixture, or if there is partial fuel rystem restriction.)
3. Try other fuel tanks. (Water in the fuel could take some time to be used up, and
allowing the engine to windmill may restore power. If power loss is due to water, fuel
pressure indications will be normal.)
NO13
If engine failure was caused by fuel exhaustion, power will not be
regained after tanks are switched until empty fuel lines are filled,
which may require up to ten seconds.
If power is not restored, proceed with POWER OFF LANDING procedure.

POWER OFF LANDING
If loss of power occurs at altitude, trim the aircraft for best gliding angle (100 MPH IAS,
Air Cond. - OFF), and look for a suitable field. If measures taken to restore power are not
effective, and if time permits, check your charts for airports in the immediate vicinity;it may be
possible to land at one if you have sufficient altitude. At best gliding angle, with the engine
windmilling and the propeller control in full "DECREASE RPM," the airplane will travel
approximately one and one half miles for each one thousand feet of altitude. If possible, notify
the FAA by radio of your difficulty and intentions. If another pilot or passenger is aboard, let
them help.
When you have located a suitable field, establish a spiral pattern around this field. Try to
be at 1000 feet above the field at the downwind position to make a normal approach. When the
field can easily be reached, slow up to 90 MPH IAS for the shortest landing. Excess altitude may
be lost by widening your pattern, using flaps or slipping, or a combination of these.
Touchdown should normally be made at the lowest
When committed to landing:
l. Ignition - Off
2. Master Switch - Off
3. Fuel Selector - Off
4. Mixture - Idle Cut0ff
5. Seat Belt (and harness if available) - Tightpossible airspeed, with full flaps.
PROPELLER O\IERSPEED
Propeller overspeed is caused by a malfunction in the propeller governor, or low oil
pressure, which allows the propeller blades to rotate to full low pitch. If this should occur,
proceed as follows:
I. THROTTLE-RETARD
2. OIL PRESSURE. CHECK
3. PROPELLER CONTROL - FULL DECREASE RPM. THEN SET IF A}.IY CONTROL
IS AVAILABLE.
4. REDUCE AIRSPEED
s. THROTTLE - AS REQUIRED TO REMAIN BELOW 2700 RpM.

immediately use the following recovery procedures:
I. THROTTLE . IDLE
2. RUDDER . FULL OPPOSITE TO DIRECTION OF ROTATION

4. RUDDER. NEUTRAL (WHEN ROTATION STOPS)
5. CONTROL WHEEL - AS REQUTRED TO SMOOTHLY REGATN LEVEL FLrcH'r
ATTITUDE
OPEN DOOR
The cabin door on the Cherokee is double latched, so the chances of its springing open in
flight at both the top and bottom are remote. However, should you forget the upper latch, or
not fully engage the lower latch, the door may spring partially open. This will usually happen at
takeoff or soon afterward. A partially open door will not affect normal flight characteristics,
and a normal landing can be made with the door open.
'i If both upper and lower latches are open, the dooi will trail slightly open, and airspeed will
be reduced slightly.
:; To close the door in flight, proceed as follows:
l. Slow airqaft to 100 MPH lAS.
2. Cabin Vents - Close
3. Storrn Window - Open
4. If upper latch is open - latch. If lower latch is open - open top latch, push door
further open, and then close rapidly. Latch top latch.
A slip in the direction of the open.door will assist in latching procedure.

FIRE
The presence of fire is noted through smoke, smell, and heat in the cabin. It is essential
that the source of the fire be promptly identified through instrument readings, character of the
smoke, or other indications, since the action to be taken differs somewhat in each case.
SOURCE OF FIRE . CHECK
t.Electrical Fire (Smoke in Cabin):
a. Master Switch - Off
b. Vents - Open
c. Cabin Heat - Off
d. Land as soon as possible.
Engine Fhe (In Flight):
a. Fuel Selector - Off
b. Throttle - Closed
c. Mixture - Idle Cut0ff
d. Heater - Off (In all cases of fire)
e. Defroster - Off (In all cases of fire)
f. If terrain permits, land immediat6ly.
NOTE
The possibility of an engine fue in fli&t is extremely remote.
The procedure given above is general and pilot judgment should
be the deciding factor for action in such an emergency.
Engine Fire (During Start):
Engine fres during start are usually the result of overpriming. The following
procedure is designed to draw the excess fuel back into the induction system.
a. If engine has not started:
(l) Mixture -Idle CutOff
(2) Throtfle - Open
(3) Turn engine with starter (This is an attempt to pull the fre into the
engine.)
b. If engine has already started and is running, continue operating to try pulling the
fire into the engine.
c. In either case stated in (a) and (b), if the fire continues longer than a few
seconds, the fire should be extinguished by the best available external means.
d. If external fire extinguishing is to be applied:
( I ) Fuel Selector Valves - Off
(2) Mixture - Idle CutOff

LOSS OF OIL PRESSURE
Loss of oil pressure may be either partial or complete. A partial loss of oil pressure usually
indicates a malfunction in the oil pressure regulating system, and a landing should be made as
soon as possible to investigate the cause and prevent engine damage.
A complete loss of oil pressure indication may signify oil exhaustion or may be the result
of a faulty gauge. In either case, proceed toward the nearest airport, and be prepared for a
forced landing. If the problem is not a pressure gauge malfunction, the engine may stop
zuddenly. Maintain altitude until zuch time as a dead stick landing can be accomplished. Don't
change power settings unnecessarily, as this may hasten complete power loss.
Depending on the circumstances, it may be advisable to make an off airport landing while
power is still available, particularly if other indications of actual oil pressure loss, such as sudden
increases in temperatures, or oil smoke, are apparent, and an airport is not close.
If engine stoppage occurs, proceed to POWER OFF LANDING.
LOSS OF FUEL PRESSURE
i. l. Electric Boost Pump - On
,; 2. Fuel Selector - Check on full tank
If problem is not an empty fuel tank, land as soon as practical and have engine-driven fuel
pump checked.
HIGH OIL TEMPERATURE
An abnormaly high oil temperature indication may be caused by a low oil level, an
obstruction in the oil cooler, damaged or improper baffle seals, a defective gauge, or other
causes. Land as soon as practical at an appropriate airport and have the cause investigated
A steady, rapid rise in oil temperature is a sign of trouble. Land at the nearest airport and
let a mechanic investigate the problem. Watch the oil pressure gauge for an accompanying loss
of preszure.

ALTERNATOR FAILURE
Loss of alternator output is detected through zero reading on the ammeter. Before
executing the fotlowing procedure, insure that the reading is zero and not merely low by
actuating an electrically powered device, such as the landing light. If no increase in the ammeter
reading is noted, alternator failure can be assumed.
,, l. Reduce Electrical Load.
2. Alternator Circuit Breakers - Check
3. "Alt" Switch - Off (for I second), then On
If the ammeter continues to indicate no output, or alternator will not stay reset, turn off
"Alt" switch, maintain minimum electrical load and land as soon as practical. All electrical load
is being supplied by the battery'
ENGINE ROUGHNESS
Engine roughness may be caused by dirt in the injector nozzles, induction system icing, or
ignition problems. To eliminate roughness, proceed as follows:
l. Mixture - Adjust for maximum smoothness. Engine will run rough if too rich or too
Iean.
2. Alternate Air - On
3. Electric Fuel Pump - On
4. Fuel Selector - Change tanks to see if fuel contamination is the problem.
5. Engine Gauges - Check for abnormal readings. If any gauge readings are abnormal,
proceed accordingly.
6, Magneto Switch - "L" then "R," then back to "BOTH." If opcration is satisfactory
on either magneto, proceed on that magneto at reduced power, with mixture full rich,
to a lauding at the frst available airport-
If roughness persists, prepare for a precautionary landing at pilot's discretion.

WEIGHT AND BALANCE
In order to achieve the performance, safety and good flying characteristics which are
designed into the airplane, it must be flown with the weiglrt and center of gravity (C.G.)
position wthin the approved envelope. The aircraft offers a tremendous flexibility of loading.
However, you cannot fill the airplane, with the maximum number of adult passengers, full fuel
tanks and maximum baggage. With the flexibility comes responsibility. The pilot must ensure
that the airplane is loaded within the loading envelope before he makes a takeoff.
Misloading carries consequences for any aircraft. An overloaded airplane will not take off,
climb or cruise as well as a properly loaded one. The heavier the airplane is loaded, the less
climb perfornance it will have.
Center of gravity is a determining factor in flight characteristics. If the C.G. is too far
forward in any airplane, it may be difficult to rotate for takeoff or landing. If the C.G. is too far
aft, the airplane may rotate prematurely on takeoff or try to pitch up during climb.
Longitudinal stability will be reduced. This can lead to inadvertent stalls and even spins; and
spin recovery becomes more difficult as the center of gravity moves aft of the approved limit.
' A properly loaded aircraft, however, will perform as intended. This airplane is designed to
provide excellent performance and safety within the flight envelope. Before the airplane is
delivered, it is weighed, and a basic weight and C.G. location is computed. (Basic weight consists
of the empty weight of the aircraft plus the unusable fuel and full oil capacity.) Using the basic
weight and C.G. location, the pilot can easily determine the weight and C.G. position for the
loaded airplane by computing the total weight and moment and then determining whether they
are within the approved envelope.
The basic weight and C.G. location for a phrticular airplane are recorded in the aircraft log
book or in the weight and balance section of the Airplane Flight Manual. The current values
should always be used. Whenever new equipment is added or any modification work is done, the
mechanic responsible for the work is required to compute a new basic weight and basic C.G.
position and to write these in the aircraft log book. The owner should make sure that it is done.
A weight and balance calculation can be helpful in determining how much fuel or baggage
can be boarded so as to keep the C.G. within allowable limits. If it is necessary to remove some
of the fuel to stay within maximum allowable gross weight, the pilot should not hesitate to do
so.
The following pages are forms used in weighing an airplane in production and in computing
basic weight, basic C.G. position, and useful load. Note that the useful load includes fuel, oil,
baggage, cargo and passengers. Following this is the method for computing takeoff weight and
c.G.

WEIGIIT AND BALANCE DATA
WEIGIIING PROCEDURE
At the time of delivery, Piper Aircraft Corporation provides each airplane with the licensed
empty weight and center of gravity location. This data is on Page 5-7.
The removal or addition of an excessive amount of equipment or excessive airplane
modifications can affect the licensed empty weight and empty weight center of gravity. The
following is a weighing procedurc to determine this licensed empty weight and center of gravity
location:
I. PREPARATION
Be certain that all items checked in the airplane equipment list are installed
in the proper location in the airplane.
Remove excessive dirt, grease, moisture, foreign items such as rags and tools
from the airplane before weighing.
Defuel airplane. Then open all fuel drains until all remaining fuel is drained.
Operate engine on each tank until all undrainable fuel is used and engine
stops.
Drain all oil from the engine, by means of the oil drain, with the airplane in
ground attitude. This will leave the undrainable oil still in the system.
Engine oil temperature should be in the normal operating range before
draining.
Place pilot and copilot seats in fourth (4th) notch, aft of forward position.
Put flaps in the fully retracted position and all control surfaces in the
neutral position. Tow bar strould be in the proper location and all entrance
and baggage doors closed.
f. Weieh the airplane inside a closed building to prevent errors in scale
readings due to wind.
2.LEVELING
With airplane on scales, block main gear oleo pistons in the fully extended
position.
Level airplane (see diagram) deflating nose wheel tire, to center bubble on

OPERATING IN STRU CTION S
PREFLIGHT
The airplane should be given a thorough preflight and walk-around inspection. The
preflight should include a check of the airplane's operational status, computation of weight and
C.G. limits, takeoff distance, and in flight performance. A weather briefing should be obtained
for the intended fliglrt path, and any other factors relating to a safe flight should be checked
before takeoff.
Walk-Around Inspection

WARM-UP
Warm-up the engine at 1000 to 1200 RPM. Avoid prolonged idling at low RPM, as thispractice may result in fouled spark plugs.
Takeoff may be made as soon as the ground check is completed, provided that the throttle
may be opened fully without backfiring or skipping, and without a reduction in engine oil
pressure.
Do not operate the engine at high RPM when running up or taxiing over ground containing
loose stones, gravel or any loose material that may cause damage to the propeller blades.
GROUND CHECK
The magnetos should be checked at 2000 RPM with the propeller set at high RPM. Drop
off on either magneto should not exceed 175 RPM and the difference between the magnetos
should not exceed 50 RPM. Operation on one magneto should not exceed l0 seconds.
. Check the vacuum gauge;the indicator should read 5.0" + .1" Hg at 2000 RPM. ;
i Check both oil temperature and oil pressure. The temperature may be low for some time if
the engine is being run for the first time of the day, but as long as the pressure is within limits
the engine is ready for takeoff.
Check the annunciator panel lights with the pressto-test buttonr.
The propeller control sttould be moved through its complete range to check for proper
operation, and then placed in full INCREASE RPM for takeoff. To obtain maximum RPM, push
the pedestal mounted control fully forward on the instrument panel. Do not allow a drop of
more than 500 RPM during this check. In cold weather the propeller control should be cycled
from higlr to low RPM at least three times before takeoff to make sure that warm engine oil has
circulated.
The electric fuel pump should be turned off after starting or during warm-up to make sure
that the engine driven pump is operating. Prior to takeoff the electric pump should be turned
ON again to prevent loss of power during takeoff should the engine driven pump fail. The
engine is warm enough for takeoff when the throttle can be opened without the engine
faltering.

l. Fuel on proper tank
2. Electric fuel pump on
3. Engine gauges checked

L4. Air conditioner off
The takeoff technique is conventional for the Cherokee Six. The tab should be set slightly
aft of neutral, with the exact setting determined by the loading of the aircraft. Allow the
airplane to accelerate to 65 to 70 MPH, then ease back on the wheel enough to let the airplane
fly itself off the ground. Premature raising of the nose, or raising it to an excessive angle, will
result in a delayed takeoff. After takeoff let the aircraft accelerate to the desired climb speed by
lowering the nose slightly.
Takeoffs are normally made with flaps extended 10" (first notch).
Short Field, Obstacle Clearance:
Lower flaps to 25" (second notch), accelerate aircraft to 65-70 miles per hour and ease
back on the wheel to rotate. After breaking ground, accelerate to best angle of climb speed, 95
miles per hour, and climb past obstacle. Continue climb and accelerate to best rate of climb
speed, 105 miles per hour, and slowly retract the flaps.
Short Field, No Obstacle:
Lower flaps to 25o (second notch), accelerate aircraft to 65-70 miles per hour and ease
back on the wheel to rotate. After breaking ground, accelerate to best rate of climb speed, 105
miles per hour, and slowly retract the flaps while climbing out.
Soft Field, Obstacle Clearance:
Lower flaps to 25 " (second notch), accelerate aircraft, pull nose gear off as soon as
possible and lift off at lowest possible airspeed. Accelerate just above the ground to best angle
of climb speed, 95 miles per hour, to climb past obstacle clearance height. Continue climb while
accelerating to best rate of climb speed, 105 miles per hour, and slowly retract the flaps.
Soft Field, No Obstacle:
Lower flaps to 25 " (second notch), accelerate aircraft, pull nose gear off as soon
possible and lift off at lowest possible airspeed. Accelerate just above the ground to best rate
climb speed, 105 miles per hour, and climb out while slowly retracting the flaps.

CLIMB
The best rate of climb at gross weight will be obtained at 105 miles per hour. The best
angle of climb may be obtained at 95 miles per hour. At lighter than gross weight these speeds
are reduced somewhat.* For climbing en route, a speed of I l5 miles per hour is recommended.
This will produce better forward speed and increased visibility over the nose during the climb.
When reaching the desired altitude, the electric fuel pump may be turned off.
STALI,s
The stall characteristics of the Cherokee Six :ue conventional. Visual stall warning is
provided by a red light located on the left side of the instrument panel which illuminates
automatically between 5 and l0 miles per hour above the stall speed. The gross weight stalling
speed of the Cherokee Six with power off and full flaps is 63 miles per hour. With the flaps up
this speed is increased 8 miles per hour. Loss of altitude during stalls can be as great as 350 feet,
depending on configuration and power. The stall speed chart is at gross weight. Stallspeeds.at
lo,wer weights will be corespondingly less.
Stall speed in mph (Calibrated Airspeed):
Flaps Up - 7l
Flaps Down - 63
CRI.IISING
The cruising speed of the Cherokee Six is determined by many factors, including power
setting, altitude, temperature,loading, and equipment installed on the airplane.
The normal maximum cruising power is 75% of the rated horsepower of the engine. True
airspeeds, which can be obtained at various altitudes and power settings, can be determined
from the Performance Charts Section.
When selecting cruising RPM below 2300, limiting manifold pressure for continuous
operation, as specified by the appropriate "Avco-Lycoming Operator's Manual," should be
observed.
To obtain the desired power, set the manifold pressure and RPM according to the power
setting table in this manual. After the desired power settings have been set up, adjust the
mixture control for corresponding best power setting as indicated by the fuel flow meter. The
low side of the power setting, as shown on the fuel flow meter, indicates best economy for that
percent of power while the high side indicated best power.
*To obtain the performance prcsented in the Performance Section of this manual, full power
(full throttle and 2700 RPM) must be used.
OPERATING INSTRUCTION S
REVISED: FEBRUARY 2, 197 6 74

--- Page 75 ---
CHEROKEE SIX - 3OO
Use of the mixture control in cruising flight reduces fuel consumption significantly,
especially at higher altitudes. The mixture should be leaned during cruising operation above
5000 feet altitude and at pilot's discretion at lower altitudes when 7 57o power or less is being
used. If any doubt exists as to the amount of power being used, the mixture should be in the
FULL RICH position for all operations under 5000 feet.
To lean the rnixture, disengage lockr and pull the mixture control until the engine
becomes rough, indicating that the lean mixture limit has been reached in the leaner cylinders.
Then enrich the mixture by pushing the control towards the instrument panel until engine
operation becomes smooth. The fuel flow meter will give a close approximation of the fuel
being consumed.
If the airplane is equipped with the optional exhaust gas temperature (EGT) gauge, a more
accurate means of leaning is available to the pilot. Fbr this procedure, refer to the
"Avco-Lycoming Operator's Manual."
ln order to keep the airplane in best lateral trim during cruise flight, the fuel should be
used alternately from each main tank, and when these are nearly exhausted, from each tip tank.
It is recommended that one main tank be used for one hour after takeoff, the other main tank
used until nearly exhausted, then retum to the first main tank. When nearly exhausted, turn to
one tip tank and alternate at one-half hour intervals to maintain lateral trim.
The following listing contains, as a reminder, a few of the more highly recommended fuel
operation procedures:
l. Fuel quantity should be visually checked in all fuel tanks before entering the aircraft.
2. After using the undeneat quick drain, it should be checked from outside the aircraft
to make sure it has closed completely, and is not leaking.
3. Takeoff should be mide on the tank with the highest quantity of fuel to assure best
fuel flow, and this tank selected before or immediately after starting in order to allow
fuel flow to be adequately established before takeoff. The tank with the highest
quantity of fuel strould be selected for landing.
Fuel tank selection at low altitude is not recommended, since little recovery time is
available in the event of an elTor in tank selection. When switching tanks, make sure
that the selector drops into a detent, and is lined up with the desired tank.
The electric fuel pump should be turned on before switching tanks, and should be left
on for a short period thereafter.
To preclude making a hasty selection, and to provide continuity of flow, the selector
should be changed to another tank before fuel is exhausted from the tank in use.
Operation of the engine driven fuel pump should be checked while taxiing or during
pretakeoff engine run up by switching off the electric fuel pump and observing fuel
pressure.
During cruise, the electric fuel pump should be in the off position so that any
malfunction of the engine driven fuel pump is immediately apparent.
If signs of fubl starvation should occur at any tirne during flight, fuel exhaustion
should be suspected, at which time the fuel selector should be immediately positioned
to a full tank and the electric fuel pump switched to the on position,
When the seventh seat is used, all weight in excess of 3l 12 pounds must be in fuel
weight only. Fill tip tanks first and use fuel from main tanks first.

TURBULENT AIR OPERATION
In keeping with good operating practice used in all aircraft, it is recommended that when
turbulent air is encountered or expected, the airspeed be reduced to maneuvering speed to
reduce the structural loads caused by gusts and to allow for inadvertent speed build-ups which
may occur as a result of the turbulence or of distractions caused by the conditions.
MANEUVERS
Intentional spins are prohibited in this airplane. [n the event that an inadvertent spin
occurs, standard recovery technique should be used immediately.
APPROACH AND LANDING
Before landing check list:
l. Seat backs erect
2. Fastenbelts/harness
3. Air Conditioning off
,4. Fuel on proper tank
'ir5. Electric fuel pump on
t0. Mixture rich
l:,7 . Propeller set
8. Flaps down (125 mph)
The airplane should be trim'med-to an approach speed of about 90 miles pcr hour with
flaps extended. The flaps can be lowered at speeds up to 125 miles per hour, if desired. The
propeller should be set at approximately 2500 RPM to facilitate ample power for an emergency
go-around and to prevent overspeeding of the engine if the throttle is advanced sharply. The
mixture control should be kept in full rich position to insure maximum acceleration if it should
be necessary to open the throttle again.
The amount of flap used during landings and the speed of the aircraft at contact with the
runway should be varied according to the landing surface and conditions of wind and airplane
loading. It is generally good practice to contact the ground at the minimum possible safe speed
consistent with existing conditions.
Normally, the best technique for short and slow landings is to use full flap and enough
power to maintain the desired airspeed and approach flight path. Mixture should be full rich,
fuel on the fullest tank, and electric fuel pump on. Reduce the speed during the flareout and
contact the ground close to the stalling speed (63 to 70 MPH). After ground contact hold the
nose wheel off as long as possible. As the airplane slows down, drop the nose and apply thc
brakes. There will be less chance of skidding the tires if the flaps are retracted before applying
the brakes. Braking is most effective when back prcssure is applied to the control wheel, putting i
most of the aircraft weight on the main wheels. In high wind conditions, particularly in strong
crosswinds, it may be desirable to approach the ground at higher than normal speeds with
partial or no flaps.

CHEROKEE SIX - 3OO
STOPPING ENGINE
At the pilot's discretion, the flaps should be raised and the electric fuel pump turned off.
After parking, the air conditioner and radios should be turned off, the propeller set in the full
increase position, and the engine stopped by disengaging the mixture control lock* and pulling
the mixture control out to idle cutoff. The throttle should be left full aft to avoid engine
vibration while stopping. Then the magneto and master switches must be turned off and the
parking brake set.

MOORING
The Cherokee Six should be moved on the ground with the aid of the nose wheel tow bar
provided with each plane and secured behind the rear seats. Tie downs can be secured to rings
provided under each wing and to the tail skid. The aileron and stabilator controls should be
secured by looping the safety belt through the control wheel and pulling it snug. The rudder is
held in position by its connections to the nose wheel steering and normally does not have to be
secured. The flaps are locked when in the full up position and should be left retracted.
WEIGHT AND BALANCE
It is the responsibility of the owner and pilot to determine that the airplane remains within
the allowable weight vs. center of gravity envelope while in flight. For weight and balance data

5. tf the "Air Cond. Door Open" light does not respond as specified above, an air
conditioner system or indicator bulb malfunction is indicated, and further
investigation should be conducted prior to flight.
The above operational check may be performed during fliglrt if an in flight failure is
suspected.
AIR CONDITIONER EFFECTS ON AIRPLAT.IE PERFORMANCE
Operation of the air conditioner will cause slight decreases in cruise speed and range. Power
from the engine is required to run the compressor, and the condenser door, when extended,
causes a slight increase in drag. When the air conditioner is turned off there is normally no
measurable difference in climb, cruise or range performance of the airplane.
NOTE
To insure maximum climb perfornance the air conditioner must
be furned off manually before takeoff to disengage the
compressor and retract the condenser door. Also the air
conditioner must be turned off manually before the landing
approach in preparation for a possible go-around.
i Although the cruise speed and range are only slightly affected by the air conditioner
.operatiou, these changes should be considered in preflight planning. To be conservative, the,following figures assume that the compressor is operating continuously while the airplane isiairborne. This will be the case only in extremely hot weather.
The decrease in true airspeed is approximately 5 mph at all power settings.
The decrease in range may be as much as 35 statute miles for the 84 gallon capacity.
The climb performance is not compromised measurably with the air conditioner operating
since the compressor is declutched and the condenser door is retracted, both automatically,
when a full throttle position is selected. When the full throttle position is not used or in the
event of a malfunction which would cause the compressor to operate and the condenser door to
be extended, a decrease in rate of climb of as much as 100 fpm can be expected. Should a
malfunction occur which prevents condenser door retraction when the compressor is turned olT,
a decrease in rate of climb of as much as 50 fpm can be expected.
EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITI:ER*
The Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) when installed, is located in the aft portion of
the fuselage just below the stabilator leading edge and is accessible through a plate on the right
side of the fuselage. (On aircraft manufactured prior to mid-1975, this plate is retained by three
steel Phillips head screws. On aircraft manufactured from mid-1975 and on, this plate is attached
with three slotted-head nylon screv/s for ease of removal; these screws may be readily removed
with a variety of common items such as a dime, a key, a knife blade, etc. If there are no tools
available in an emergency the screw heads may be broken off by any means.) The ELT is an
emergency locator transmitter which meets the requirements of FAR 91.52. The unit operates on
a self-contained battery. The replacement date as required by FAA regulations is marked on the
transmitter label.

The unit is equipped with a portable antenna to allow the locator to be removed from the
airplane in case of an emerpncy and used as a portable signal transmitter.
A pilot's remote switch, located on the left side panel, is provided to allow thc transmittcr
to be controlled from inside the cabin.
l.On some models the pilot's remote switch has flrree positions and is placarded "ON,"
"AUTO/ARM," and "OFFIRESET." The switch is normally left in the
"AUTO/ARM" position. To turn the transmitter off, move the switch momentarily
to the "OFF/RESET" position. The aircraft master switch m.ust be "ON" to turn the
transmitter "OFF," To activate the transmitter for tests or other reasons, move the
switch upward to the e'ON" position and leave it in that position as long as
transmission is desired:
On other models the pilot's remote switch has two positions and is placarded
"ON/RESET" and "ARM (NORMAL POSITION)." Tlte switch is normally left in the
down or "ARM" position. To turn the transmitter off, move the switch to the
"ON/RESET" position for one second then return it to the "ARM' position. To
activate the transmitter for tests or other reasons, move the switch upward to the
"ON/RESET" position and leave it in that position as long as transmission is desired.
NOTE
If the switch has been placed in the "ON:' position for any
reason, the "OFF" position has to be selected before selecting
"ARM." lf "ARM" is selected directly from the "ON" position,
the unit will con.tinue to tran.srnit in the "ARM" position.
The locator should be checked during the ground check to make certain the unit has not
been accidentally activated. Check by tuning a radio receiver to 121.5 MHz. If there is an
oscillating sourrd, tlte locator may ltave been activated and should be turned off immcdiatcly.
Reset to the "ARM" position and check again to insure against outside interference.
NOTE
If for any reason a test transmission is necessary, the test
transmission .should be conducted only in the fint five minutes
of any hour and limited to three audio sweeps. If tests must be
made at any other time, the tests should be coordinated witlt the
nearest FAA tower or flight service station.)

OPERATING TIPS
The following Operating Tips are of particular value in the operation of the Cherokee
PA-32-300.
l. Learn to trim for takeoff so that only a very light back pressure on the wheel is
required to lift the airplane off the ground.
The best speed for takeoff is about 70 MPH under normal conditions. Trying to pull
the airplane off the ground at too low an airspeed decreases the controllability of the
airplane in event of engine failure.
Flaps may be lowered at airspeeds up to 125 MPH. To reduce flap operating loads, it
is desirable to have the airplane at a slower speed before extending the flaps.
Before attempting to reset any circuit breaker, allow a two to five minute cooling off
period.
Before starting the engine, check that all radio switches, light switches and the pitot
heat switch are in the off position so as not to create an overloaded condition when
the starter is engaged.
The overvoltage relay is provided to protect the electronics equipment from a
momentary overvoltage condition (approximately 16.5 volts and up), or a
catastrophic regulator failure. In the event of a momentary condition, the relay will
open and the ammeter will indicate "0" output from the alternator. The relay may be
reset by switching the ALT switch to OFF for approximately one second and then
retuming the ALT switch to ON. If after recycling the ALT switch the condition
persists, the flight should be terminated as soon as practical. Reduce the battery load
to a minimum. The ALT light on the annunciator panel* will illuminate if the
alternator fails. Recycle the ALT switch and check the ALT FIELD circuit breaker. If
the failure persists after this action, reduce electrical loads and land as soon as
practical.
The vacuum gauge is provided to monitor the pressure available to assure the correct
operating speed of the vacuum driven gyroscopic flight instruments.It also monitors
the condition of the common air filter by measuring the flow of air through the filter.
If the vacuum gauge does not register 5" t .10" Hg at 2000 RPM, the following
items should be checked before flight:
a. Common air filter could be dirty or restricted.
b. Vacuum lines could be collapsed or broken.
c. Vacuum pump worn.
d. Vacuum regulator, not adjusted correctly. The pressure, even though set
corectly, can read lower under two conditions: (l) Very high altitude,
above 12000 feet, (2) Low engine RPM, usually on approach or during
training maneuvers. This is normal and should not be considered a
malfunction.

8. The shape of the wing fuel tanks is such that in certain maneuvers the fuel may move
away from the tank outlet. If the ouflet is uncovered, the fuel flow will be
itrterrupted and a temporary loss of power may result. Pilots can prevent inadvertent
uncovering of the outlet by avoiding maneuvers which could result in uncovering the
outlet.
Extreme running turning takeoffs should be avoided as fuel flow interruption
may occur.
Prolonged slips or skids which result in excess of 2000 feet of altitude loss, or
other radical or extreme maneuvers which could cause uncovering of the fuel outlet
must be avoided as fuel flow interruption may occur when tank being used is not full.
Anti4ollision lights should not be operating when flying through overcast and clouds,
since reflected light can produce spacial disorientation. Do not operate strobe lights
when taxiing in the vicinity of other aircraft.
The rudder pedals are suspended from a torque tube which extends across the
fuselage. The pilot should become familiar with the proper positioning of his feet on
the rudder pedals so as to avoid interference with the torque tube when moving the
rudder pedals or operating the toe brakes.
In an effort to avoid accidents, pilots should obtain and study the safety related
information made available in FAA publications such as regulations, advisory
circulars, Aviation News, AIM and safety aids.

This section contains information on preventive maintenance. Refer to the PA-32 Service
Manual for furrher maintenance procedures. Any complex repair or modification should be
accomplished b1' a Piper Certified Sewice Center.
GROUND HA}iDLING
TOWING
The airplane may be moved on the ground by the use of the nose wheel steering bar
that is stowed below the fonvard ledge of the rear baggage compartment or by power
equipment that will not damage or excessively strain the nose gear steering assembly.
Towing lugs are incorporated as part of the nose gear forks.
CAUTION
When towing with power equipment, do not turn the nose gear
beyond its steering radius in either direction, as this will result in
damage to the nose gear and steering mechanism.
CAUTION
Do not tow the airplane when the controls are secured.
In the event towing lines are necessary, ropes should be attached to both main gear
struts as high up on the tubes as possible. Lines should be long enough to clear the nose
and/or tail by not less than fifteen feet, and a qualified person should ride in the pilot's
seat to maintain control by use of the brakes.
TAXIING
Before attempting to taxi the airplane, ground personnel should be instructed and
approved by a qualified person authorized by the owner. Engine starting and shutdown
procedures as well as taxi techniques sttould be covered. When it is ascertained that the
propeller back blast and taxi areas are clear, power should be applied to start the taxi roll,
and the following checks should be performed:
a. Taxi a few feet forward and apply the brakes to determhe their effectiveness.
b. Taxi with the propeller set in low pitch, high RPM setting.
c. While taxiing, make slight turns to ascertain the effectiveness of the steering.
d. Observe wing clearances when taxiing near buildings or other stationary objects.
If possible, station an observer outside the.airplane.
e. When taxiing over uneven ground, avoid holes and ruts.
f. Do not operate the engine at high RPM when running up or taxiing over ground
containing loose stones, gravel, or any loose material that may cause damage to
the propeller blades.

PARKING
When parking the airplane, be sure that it is sufficiently protected from adverse
weather conditions and that it presents no danger to other aircraft. When parking the
airplane for any length of time or overnight, it is suggested that it be moored securely.
a. To park the airplane, head it into the wind if possible.
b. Set the parking brake by pulling back on the brake lever and depressing the knob
on the handle. To release the parking brake, pull back on the handle until the
catch disengages; then allow the handle to swing forward.
CAUTION
Care should be taken when setting brakes that are overheated or
during cold weather when accumulated rnoisture may freeze a
brake.
c. Aileron and stabilator controls may be secured with the front seat belt. Wheel
chocks may be used if available.
MOORING
The airplane should be moored for immovabitity, security, and protection. The
following procedures should be used for the proper mooring of the airplane:
a. Head the airplane into the wind if possible.
b. Retract the flaps.
c. Immobilize the ailerons and stabilator by looping the seat belt through the
control wheel and pulling it snug.
d. Block the wheels.
e. Secure tiedown ropes to the wing tiedown rings and to the tail skid at
approximately 45 degree angles to the ground. When using rope of non-synthetic
material, leave sufficient slack to avoid damage to the airplaae should the ropes
contract.
CAUTION
Use bowline knots, square knots or locked slip knots. Do not use
plain slip knots.
NOTE
Additional preparations for high winds include using tiedown
ropes from the landing gear forks and securing the rudder.
t. . Install a pitot head cover if available. Be sure to remove the pitot head
before flight.
g. Cabin and baggage doors should be locked when the airplane is unattended.

CLEANING EXTERIOR SURFACES
The airplane should be washed with a mild soap and water. Harsh abrasives or alkaline
soaps or detergents could make scratches on painted or plastic surfaces or could cause
corrosion of metal. Cover areas where cleaning solution could cause damage. To wash the
airplane, use the following procedure:
a. Flush away loose dirt with water.
b. Apply cleaning solution with a soft cloth, a sponge or a soft bristle brush.
c. To remove exhaust stains, allow the solution to remain on the surface longer.
d. To remove stubborn oil and grease, use a cloth dampened with naphtha.
e. Rinse all surfaces thoroughly.
f. Any good automotive wax rnay be used to preserve painted surfaces. Soft
' cleaning 'cloths'or a'chamois'should' be,used',to'prevent scratches'when cleaning
or polishing. A heavier coating of wax on the leading surfaces will reduce the
abrasion problems in these areas.
CLEANING WINDSHIELD AND WINDOWS
a. Remove dirt, mud and other loose particles from exterior surfaces with clean
water.
b. Wash with mild soap and warm water or with aircraft plastic cleaner. Use a soft
cloth or sponge in a straight back and forth motion. Do not rub harshly

spacer tubes from between the fork. Wheels are replaced by reversing the procedure.
Tires are removed from the wheels by deflating the tire, removing the through bolts. and
separating the wheel halves.
Landing gear oleo struts should be checked for proper strut exposure and visible leaks. The
required extensions for the struts under normal static load (empty weight of airplane plus full
fuel and oil) are 3-l/4 inches for the nose gear and 4-ll2 inches for the main gear.If the strut
exposure is below that required, it should be determined whether air or oil is needed by first
raising the airplane on jacks. Depress the valve core to allow air to escape from the strut housing
chamber. Remove the filler plug and slowly raise the strut to full compression. If the fluid is
then visible up to the bottom of the filler plug hole, only proper inflation with air is required.
If fluid is below the bottom of the filler plug hole, oil should be added. Replace the plug
with the valve core removed. Then attach a clear plastic hose to the valve stem of the filler plug
and submerge the free end in a container of hydraulic nuid (MILH-5606). Fully compress and
extend the strut several times, thus drawing fluid into the strut chamber and expelling air. To
allow fluid to enter the bottom chamber of the nose gear strut housing, it is necessary to
disconnect the torque link assembly and allow the strut to extend a full l0 inches. (The nose
gear torque links need not be disconnected.) DO NOT allow the strut to extend beyond 12
inches. When air bubbles cease to flow through the hose, fully comprcss the strut, remove the
filler plug, and again check the fluid level. When the fluid level is correct, disconnect the hose,
reinstall the valve core, the filler plug, and the main gear torque links.
With the fluid in the strut housing at the proper level, attach a strut pump to the air valve.
With the airplane on the ground under normal static load, inflate the oleo strut to the proper
strut exposure.
In jacking the airplane for landing gear or other service, two hydraulic jacks and a tail stand
should be used. At least 350 pounds of ballast should be placed on the base of the tail stand
before jacking up the airplane. The hydraulic jacks are placed under the jack points orr the
underside of the wings, and the airplane is jacked up until the tail stand can be attached to the
tail skid. After attaching the tail stand and adding ballast, the jacking can be continued until the
airplane is at the desired height.

PROPELLER SERVICE
The spinner and backing plate should be cleaned and inspected for cracks frequently.
Before each flight the propeller should be inspected for nicks, scratches, and corrosion. If
found, they should be repaired as soon as possible by a rated mechanic, since a nick or scratch
causes an area of increased stress which can lead to serious cracks or the loss of a propeller tip.
The back face of the blades should be painted when necessary with flat black paint to retard
glare. To prevent corosion, the zurface should be cleaned and waxed periodically.
OIL REQUIREMENTS
The oil capacity of the Lycoming IO-540 series engine is 12 quarts, and the minimum safe
quantity is 2-314 quarts. It is recommended that the oil be changed every 50 hours and sooner
under unfavorable operating conditions. The following grades are recommended for the
specified temperatures:

' At every 50 hour inspection, the fuel screens in the strainer and in the injector must
be cleaned. The screen in the injector is located in the housing where the fuel line connects
to the injector. The fuel strainer is located under the floor panel and is accessible for
cleaning through an access plate on the underside of the fuselage. After cleaning, a small
amount of grease applied to the gasket will facilitate reassembly.
FUEL REQUIREMENTS
Aviation grade fuel with a minimum octane of 100/130 must be used in this airplane.
Since the use of lower gtrades can cause serious engine damage in a short period of time, the
engine warranty is invalidated by the use of lower octanes.
FILLING FUEL TANKS
Observe all safety precautions required when handling gasoline. Fill the fue-l*tanks
through the filler located on the forward slope of the wings and on the wing tips. Each
wing tank holds a maximum of 25 U.S. gallons, and each wing tip tank holds a maximum
of 17 U.S. gallons. When using less than the standard 84 gallon capacity, fuel shotrld be
distributed equally between each side, with the wing tip tanks filled first.

Fuel Drain
DRAINING FIJEL VALVES AND LINES
The fuel system strould be drained before the first flight of the day and after refueling
to avoid the accumulation of water and sediment. Each fuel tank has an individual quick
drain at the lower inboard corner. A fuel strainer with a fuel system quick drain is located
at the lowest point in the system. Each tank strould be drained through its individual quick
drain until sufficient fuel has flowed to ensure the removal of any contaminants. The fuel
system quick drain, operated by a lever inside the cabin on the right forward edge of the
wing spar housing, should be opened while the fuel selector valve is moved through the
four different. tank positions. Enough fuel should flow at each position to allow the fuel
lines and the strainer to clear. A container is provided for the checking of fuel clarity. (See
Description - Airplane and Systems Section for more detailed instructions.)
CAUTION
When draining fuel, be sure that no fire lnzard exists before
starting the engine.
After using the fuel system quick drain, check from outside the airplane to be sure
that it has closed completely and is not leaking.

DRAIMNG FI'EL SYSTEM
The bulk of the fuel may be drained by opening the individual drain on each tank.
The remaining fuel may be drained tfuough the fuel strainer. Any individual tank may be
drained by closing the fuel selector valve and then draining the desired tank.
TIRE INFLATTON
For maximum service from the tires, keep them inflated to the proper pressures - 28-30
psi for the nose gear and 3540 psi for the main gear. All wheels and tires are balanced before
original installation,. and -the relationship. of tire, tube, and wheel should be maintained "upon
reinstallation. Unbalanced wheels can cause extreme vibration in the landing gear; therefore, in
the installation of new components, it may be necessary to rebalance the wheels with the tires
mounted. When checking tire pressure, examine the tires for wear, cuts, bruises, and slippage.
BATTERY SERVICE
Access to the l2-volt battery is through a removable panel in the floor of the .forward
bAggage compartment. The battery box has a plastic tube which is normally closed off with a
chp and which should be opened occasionally to drain off any accumulation of liquid. The
blttery should be checked for proper fluid level. DO NOT fill the battery above the baffle
plates. DO NOT fill the battery with acid - use water only. A hydrometer check will determine
the percent of charge in the battery.
If the battery is not up to charge, recharge starting at a 4 amp rate and finishing with a 2
amp rate. Quick charges are not recommended.
FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOI{
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) occasionally publishes Airworthiness
Directives (ADs) that apply to specific groups of aircraft. They are mandatory changes and are
to be complied with within a time limit set by the FAA. When an AD is issued, it is sent to the
latest registered owner of the affected aircraft and also to subscribers of the service. The owner
should periodically check with his Piper dealer or A & P mechanic to see whether he has the
latest issued AD against Ns aircraft.
